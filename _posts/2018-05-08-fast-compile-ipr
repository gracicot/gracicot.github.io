# IPR May make modules faster

Module. I just cannot wait to move all my code to them. I'm sick of headers.
Well, they won't disappear in an instant, but a whole bunch of them will when module will be official. I see modules as a
general, clean way to componentize my code and expose clear interfaces. Some see then primarly as a tool to make compilation faster,
and indeed it will most of the time, make your code compile faster... wait... *most* of the time? Can module really slow down compilation?

In this post we will see how module can slow down compilation in some case, and how I see IPR as a viable solution to fix it.

## From parallel To Serial

Compiling a large mode base is slow. Right now, each cpp file is preprocessed. Every file a compilation unit includes is textually
appended at the inclusion point. Do that for 800 compilation unit, and you'll compile 800 times the same code. What a waste of resource!

Even if it seems stupid, it has an advantage: each compilation unit is completely independent. I could compile each processed unit
one by one or... all at once! This is the advantage of the current model: one compilation unit is not waiting for another one to be compiled.

Well, module don't have

## What's IPR?
